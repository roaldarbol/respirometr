\title{Normalize Data for Linear Drift Between Pre and Post Measurements}
\usage{
normalise_drift_means(data, pre, post)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector containing the measurements to be normalized}

\item{pre}{Numeric vector or single value representing pre-measurement(s)}

\item{post}{Numeric vector or single value representing post-measurement(s)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{data} containing the
normalized values
}
\description{
This function normalizes a data vector by subtracting a linear interpolation
between the means of pre and post measurements. This is useful for correcting
measurement drift in experimental data.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calculates mean of pre-measurements if multiple values provided
\item Calculates mean of post-measurements if multiple values provided
\item Creates a linear interpolation between pre and post means
\item Subtracts interpolated values from the data to correct for drift
}
}
\examples{
# Single pre/post values
data <- c(15, 16, 17, 18, 19)
normalise_drift_means(data, pre = 10, post = 20)

# Multiple pre/post values
normalise_drift_means(
  data = c(15, 16, 17, 18, 19),
  pre = c(10, 11, 12),
  post = c(19, 20, 21)
)
