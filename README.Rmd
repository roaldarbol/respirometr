*An R toolbox for analysing respirometry data*

The primary aim of the *respirometr* package is to provide a standardised workflow for analysing respirometry data in a *tidyverse*-friendly syntax. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of *respirometr* with:

Type | Source | Command
---|---|-----------------------
Development | R-universe | `install.packages('respirometr', repos = c('https://roaldarbol.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))`
Development | Github | `renv::install("roaldarbol/respirometr")`

Once you have installed the package, you can load it with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("respirometr")
```

## Documentation

See our docs to go through the workflow, one-by-one:

- [Introduction to `respirometr`](https://www.roald-arboel.com/respirometr/articles/respirometr.html)
- [Read respirometry data](https://www.roald-arboel.com/respirometr/articles/read-licor.html)
- [Combine with movement data]()

## Status
> **Warning**
>
> üèóÔ∏è The package is currently in early development and the interface is subject to change. Feel free to play around and provide feedback.


## Contribute

**If your favourite type of respirometry data or model of respirometer is not currently supported, we'd love to get a sample of your data to support it!** 

If you enjoy the package, please make sure to [cite it](#citation). If you find a bug, feel free to open an issue.
